        <p> 
            The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant
            of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene 
            wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] Dogs were the
            first species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before
            the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded 
            to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet
            that would be inadequate for other canids.[11 The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for
            various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape,
             size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting
            herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, 
            and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted 
            to human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent
           study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".[14]
